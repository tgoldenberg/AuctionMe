# auction-website
Basic auction website with Rails

#### This was a one-day challenge to construct a **Rails** app with the folowing features: 
  - user authentication from scratch - no `devise`!
  - `listing` and `bid` models with associations to user
  - ability to bid and perform CRUD operations on `listings`

#### Gems used: 
  - `bootstrap-sass`
  - `bourbon`
  - `neat`
  - `will_paginate`

**** 
## Feel free to fork / clone, and to suggest changes as well! To get started, 
  - `bundle`
  - `rake db:create`
  - `rake db:migrate`
  - `rake db:seed`

#Enjoy!
